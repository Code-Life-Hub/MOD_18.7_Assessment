# Joey Thinkful : Software Engineer

This is a personal portfolio website for Joey, a software engineer. The website is designed to be responsive and includes a navigation menu.

## Features

- **Header**: The header section includes the name of the portfolio owner and a navigation menu. The navigation menu includes links to the "Home" and "Contact" sections of the website.

- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be responsive and adjusts its layout based on the viewport size. For viewports with a width of 600px or more, the header layout changes to display the name and navigation menu side by side.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Normalize.css: A modern, HTML5-ready alternative to CSS resets.

## CSS Styles

The CSS for this project uses Flexbox for layout purposes. The header has a dark blue background, and the text is white for contrast. The font family used for the name is "Gochi Hand", and "Montserrat" is used for the navigation menu. 

On larger screens (min-width: 600px), the layout changes to a flex display with space between the name and the navigation menu. The font size of the name is reduced, and the navigation menu is repositioned to align with the name.
